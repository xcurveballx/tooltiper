# Tooltiper

**Tooltiper** is a jQuery tooltip plugin. It allows us to make customizable tooltips on webpages based on common `title` attribute that can be used with all tags.

HTML-code inside the tooltip, different animations & appearance/disappearance speed, binding to the cursor and more make Tooltiper quite handy.

## How to import

Use `npm i @curveballerpacks/tooltiper` to install the package. It has no standalone styles, all needed styles can be passed in to the plugin as settings.

Tooltiper makes use of Node's modules. It requires its only dependency - jQuery - and can be required itself in your script via `require("@curveballerpacks/tooltiper");`. NPM will manage possible duplicates/conflicts of jQuery versions in its dependency graph mostly on its own.
